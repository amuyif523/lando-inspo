# 🏎️ Project Velocity: The Ultimate Lando Norris Fan Site Roadmap

This document outlines the strategic plan to build a digital experience that rivals and exceeds the official Lando Norris website. Our goal is to combine high-performance web technology with high-energy design.

## 🌟 Core Philosophy
*   **Speed & Motion:** The site must feel fast. Transitions should be snappy, and elements should always be in subtle motion.
*   **Gen Z / Gaming Aesthetic:** Lean into the "Quadrant" brand vibe—neon, glitch effects, bold typography, and dark mode.
*   **Interactive First:** Don't just show information; let the user interact with it (3D helmets, race stats, reaction games).

---

## 🎨 Design System 2.0

### Color Palette
*   **Primary:** `Neon Yellow (#D4F711)` - The signature Lando color.
*   **Secondary:** `Deep Black (#050505)` - For high contrast.
*   **Accents:** `Electric Blue` & `Hot Pink` (Glitch effects/Quadrant vibes).
*   **Surface:** `Glassmorphism` (Blur effects) for cards and overlays.

### Typography
*   **Headings:** `Integral CF` or `Monument Extended` (Wide, bold, aggressive).
*   **Body:** `Geist Sans` or `Inter` (Clean, readable, tech-focused).

### Layout Patterns
*   **Bento Grids:** Modular, box-based layouts for stats and social feeds.
*   **Parallax Scroll:** Background elements move slower than foreground content.
*   **Horizontal Scroll:** For timelines (Career History) and Galleries (Helmets).

## 🚀 Feature Roadmap

### Phase 1: The Foundation (Current Status)
- [x] **Tech Stack Setup:** Next.js 15, Tailwind v4, Framer Motion.
- [x] **Basic Branding:** Neon theme configured.
- [x] **Hero Section:** Initial entrance animation.

### Phase 2: The "Race Hub" (Data & APIs)
*   **Live Race Countdown:** A ticking timer to the next Grand Prix.
*   **Circuit Data:** Dynamic map of the upcoming track (using SVG or Canvas).
*   **Live Stats:** Integration with an F1 API (e.g., OpenF1 or Ergast) to show:
    *   Current Championship Standing.
    *   Last Race Result.
    *   Fastest Lap stats.

### Phase 3: The "Helmet Hall of Fame" (Visuals)
*   **Interactive Gallery:** A filterable grid of helmets (Season, Special Editions).
*   **3D Viewer:** Implement `React Three Fiber` to allow users to rotate a 3D model of the current season's helmet.
*   **"Behind the Design":** Modal popups explaining the story behind special helmets (e.g., Basketball, Glitch).

### Phase 4: The "Streamer" Vibe (Social & Media)
*   **Twitch Integration:** A "Live Now" indicator if Lando is streaming.
*   **Social Wall:** A masonry grid aggregating Instagram posts and Tweets.
*   **Gaming Corner:** A mini-game (Reaction Time Test) to compare user reflexes with F1 drivers.

### Phase 5: The "Merch Drop" (E-commerce Simulation)
*   **Product Showcase:** High-quality image sliders for apparel.
*   **"Lookbook" Style:** Full-screen video backgrounds of the clothing in action.
*   **Cart Interaction:** Smooth, animated cart drawer.

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

### 1. Content Management (CMS)
*   **Recommendation:** **Sanity.io**
*   **Why:** It allows you to manage Race Results, Helmet Images, and Blog posts without touching code. It has a great free tier and works perfectly with Next.js.

### 2. Animation Strategy
*   **Micro-interactions:** Buttons scale on hover, links have underline animations.
*   **Page Transitions:** Use `AnimatePresence` from Framer Motion for smooth page exits/entries.
*   **Scroll Animations:** Elements fade in, slide up, or unblur as they enter the viewport.

### 3. Performance
*   **Image Optimization:** Use `next/image` strictly.
*   **Code Splitting:** Lazy load heavy components (like the 3D viewer).
*   **Edge Caching:** Deploy to Vercel for global speed.

## 📅 Next Steps for Development

1.  **Refine the Hero:** Add a background video or a WebGL particle effect.
2.  **Build the "Stats" Component:** Create the Bento Grid layout for the homepage.
3.  **Set up Sanity CMS:** Connect the app to a backend for dynamic data.
4.  **3D Helmet Model:** Find or create a GLB model for the helmet viewer.
